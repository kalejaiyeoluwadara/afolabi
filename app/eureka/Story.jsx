          Currently, I work as a freelancer, and a creative lead at Zumbox
          Technologies.

          My career started in fall 2022 when i stumbled upon a Short video on
          YouTube ( 5 simple projects to work on as a UI/UX designer) ðŸ˜„ , after
          watching the video i decided to download the tool that was used in the
          Video ( Adobe XD at the time), and replicated the design, after i
          completed the first screen i fell in love with the process of
          designing and the end result (That was the Hook for me). Designing has
          been a medium for me to express my brilliance to people worldwide âš¡.

          {" "}
          Though, my career is fresh and still scaling, i truly believe my
          ability to infuse creative story telling into my designs makes me
          standout in the saturated design industry. I am currently based in
          Lagos, Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ (I donâ€™t mind leaving my comfort zone).
